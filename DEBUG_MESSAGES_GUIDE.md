# Debug Messages for Dedicated Compute

This document explains the debug messages that appear when using dedicated compute deployments.

## Debug Message Types

### 🎯 Dedicated Compute Messages

When a model has a `deployment_id` configured (either per-model or via environment variable):

```
🎯 Initializing dedicated compute for: OpenAI Whisper Large V3
📋 Deployment ID: deploy-whisper-large-v3-cr4h
🚀 Using dedicated compute deployment: deploy-whisper-large-v3-cr4h
💻 Model: whisper-large-v3 (dedicated deployment)
⚠️  Note: deployment_id requires newer Clarifai SDK with Model() class
```

### 🌐 Shared Compute Messages

When a model uses standard shared compute (no `deployment_id`):

```
🌐 Using shared compute for: Facebook Wav2Vec2 English
🌐 Using shared model: asr-wav2vec2-base-960h-english (standard)
```

## Message Locations

Debug messages appear in two places during transcription:

### 1. Model Initialization Phase
```
🎯 Initializing dedicated compute for: [Model Name]
📋 Deployment ID: [deployment-id]
```
- Appears when the transcription method starts
- Shows which compute type will be used
- Displays the actual deployment ID being used

### 2. API Request Phase
```
🚀 Using dedicated compute deployment: [deployment-id]
💻 Model: [model-id] (dedicated deployment)
```
- Appears when creating the API request
- Confirms the deployment ID is being used
- Shows the internal model ID

## Environment Variable Override

When `CLARIFAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID` is set, ALL models will show dedicated compute messages:

```bash
# Set environment variable
export CLARIFAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID=my-custom-deployment

# Run application - all models will use this deployment_id
python3 app.py
```

Debug output will show:
```
🎯 Initializing dedicated compute for: Facebook Wav2Vec2 English  # Normally shared
📋 Deployment ID: my-custom-deployment                            # Environment override
```

## Testing Debug Messages

Use the test script to see debug messages in action:

```bash
# Test with model-specific deployment IDs
python3 test_debug_messages.py

# Test with environment override
CLARIFAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID=test-deployment python3 test_debug_messages.py

# Test in the Streamlit app
python3 app.py
```

## Debug Message Benefits

1. **🔍 Visibility**: See exactly which compute type is being used
2. **🐛 Debugging**: Verify deployment_id configuration is working
3. **💰 Cost Tracking**: Know when you're using dedicated (paid) vs shared compute
4. **⚠️ Warnings**: Get notified about SDK compatibility issues
5. **📊 Monitoring**: Track which deployments are being used in logs

## Current Implementation Status

- ✅ **Debug Messages**: Working perfectly
- ✅ **Environment Override**: Working correctly
- ✅ **Configuration Detection**: Shows deployment_id from config and environment
- ⚠️ **API Integration**: Commented out due to gRPC protocol compatibility
- 📋 **Documentation**: Complete with examples

## Future Enhancement

To fully implement deployment_id support, the application would need to:

1. **Upgrade Clarifai SDK**: Use the newer `Model()` class instead of gRPC
2. **Update API Integration**: Use `Model(url="...", deployment_id="...")` pattern
3. **Remove Debug Warning**: Enable full deployment_id functionality

Current debug messages prepare for this future enhancement while providing valuable visibility into the configuration.

**Note**: Debug messages help verify your deployment_id configuration is working correctly, even though the current gRPC implementation doesn't fully support deployment_id yet.
